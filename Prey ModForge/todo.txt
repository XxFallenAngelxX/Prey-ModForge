## To-Do List

1. **Ensure Minimal Changes**
    - Only modify the necessary components to maximize compatibility with other mods.

2. **Add Future Support**
    - Plan and implement support for additional types of mods, such as:
        - Expanded Databases
        - Additional Python scripts
        - Modding templates

3. **Integrate C# Built Functionality**
    - Integrate C# to allow creating mods based on templates for the Prey 2017 mod loader (Chairloader), so that Chairloader simply injects the DLL mods at runtime.
        - Provide templates and settings to simplify the process for beginners.
        - Ensure compatibility with the Chairloader API for injecting mods into the game's memory.
        - Facilitate fast and easy mod creation for new users, while ensuring these mods can be installed and used seamlessly with Chairloader.
